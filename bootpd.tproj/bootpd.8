.TH BOOTPD 8 "February 12, 1999" "Apple Computer, Inc."
.SH NAME
bootpd \- Internet BOOTP Protocol Server
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.B bootpd 
[-i <interface> [-i <interface>]...]
[-n <netinfo_domain> [-n <netinfo_domain]...] [-d] [-v] [-b] [-q] [-e] [-m] 
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fIbootpd\fR implements an Internet Bootstrap Protocol (BOOTP) server as
defined in RFC951, RFC1542, and RFC2132.
.PP
One host on each network segment is normally configured to run \fIbootpd\fR
by setting \fICONFIGSERVER=-YES-\fR in \fI/etc/hostconfig\fR.
.PP
The server can also be started by \fIinetd\fR by modifying the file
\fI/etc/inetd.conf\fR to include a line:
.nf

  bootps dgram udp wait root /usr/libexec/bootpd bootpd
.fi
.PP
In this case, \fIbootpd\fR is started when a BOOTP request arrives. 
The server continues
servicing requests until it is idle for more than 5 minutes, after which
it exits to conserve system resources.
.PP
When a request from a known client arrives, the server (by default) 
logs an entry to \fI/var/log/system.log\fR
indicating which client made the request, and logs another entry
once a reply is sent.  This feature can be turned off using the
.BI -q
option described below.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
.BI \-d
Remain in the foreground and produce extra debugging output to stderr.
.TP
.BI \-v
Be more verbose in messages logged to \fI/var/log/system.log\fR.
.TP
.BI \-q
Be quiet as possible.  Only report serious errors to
\fI/var/log/system.log\fR.
.TP
.B \-b
Only respond if the bootfile exists.
.TP
.B \-e
Lookup ethernet hosts using the identifier property instead of
en_address.
.TP
.B \-i <interface>
Only respond to requests received on the specified interfaces. 
For example, 
.nf
    bootpd -i en0 -i en1
.fi
forces bootpd to only respond to requests received on
ethernet ports en0 and en1.
.TP
.B \-n <netinfo_domain>
Search for host entries in the given netinfo domain.  This flag may 
appear multiple times, the order of lookups is the order in which
the flags appear.  The value "..." means search the entire netinfo
hierarchy (the default).  The <netinfo_domain> value can be
specified as a domain path or as host/tag.  For example,
.nf
        bootpd -n ...
.fi
is the same as simply invoking bootpd without any options, and
.nf
        bootpd -n .. -n localhost/local
.fi
forces \fIbootpd\fR to look in the parent domain then in the local domain.
.TP
.B \-m
Act as a network boot server for diskless Macintosh computers (see the
NetBoot Server documentation for more details on this mode of operation).
.SH "HOST DATABASE"
\fIbootpd\fR uses netinfo (see \fInetinfo(5)\fR) to lookup host entries.
[The server reads host entries from \fI/etc/bootptab\fR only if invoked
with the \fB-F\fR flag, though this mode of operation is discouraged and may
disappear in future versions of the server.]
.PP
Host entries appear as individual subdirectories within the \fI/machines\fR
directory of a netinfo domain.  The following list of 
properties are read by the server:
.TP
.B name
The name of the host.
.TP
.B en_address
Ethernet address(es) of the host stored in colon hex
ie. "%x:%x:%x:%x:%x:%x" format.
.TP
.B identifier
Client identifer(s) of the host (see -e option above)
stored as "%x/%x:%x:...:%x" where the hex byte number
preceding the slash '/' character is the hardware type,
and the bytes following the slash are in colon hex format.
Ethernet addresses stored in this format would be stored
as "1/%x:%x:%x:%x:%x:%x".
.TP
.B ip_address
IP address(es) stored in dotted decimal ie. "%d.%d.%d.%d" 
format.
.TP
.B bootfile
Executable image file to be downloaded by the client via TFTP.
.SH "BOOTP CLIENT HOST LOOKUP"
.PP
A BOOTP client is identified by its unique hardware (MAC) address, and
is stored in either the \fIen_address\fR or \fIidentifier\fR property.
By default, ethernet hosts are looked up using the \fIen_address\fR property.
.PP
The server searches for a host entry containing both its hardware address
and a relevant IP address.  A relevant IP address is one which
is useful for the subnet on which the client is attempting to boot.
If none is found, the server does not respond.  The server
supports having more than one IP address associated with a single 
client: a single BOOTP client can boot on multiple subnets at different
times (eg. a laptop that is frequently moved from one location to another).
Multiple host entries may include the same hardware address but
should have distinct IP addresses to avoid having more than one host
trying to use the same IP address.  If there is more than one relevant IP
address for a client, the server chooses the first one that it finds.
.PP
The server supports multi-homed hosts (host with the same name
but multiple IP addresses) by treating the \fIen_address\FR, \FIidentifier\FR,
and \fIip_address\fR properties as parallel arrays.  For example, consider
a host entry with the following values:
.nf
{
    "name" = "orange";
    "en_address" = { "0:5:2:f:a:b", "0:5:2:1c:9e:d6" };
    "ip_address" = { "17.202.42.110", "17.202.21.221" };
}
.fi
.PP
Host "orange" has two IP addresses associated with its name.  The interface
with ethernet address "0:5:2:f:a:b" has IP address "17.202.42.110", and
interface "0:5:2:1c:9e:d6" has IP address "17.202.21.221".
.SH "BOOTP VENDOR EXTENSIONS"
\fIbootpd\fR supplies a BOOTP client with its hostname, subnet mask, 
default router(s), domain name server(s), and domain name.
If \fIbootpd\fR has no explicitly configured values for the client's subnet,
it attempts to supply values from the server's own configuration.
Explicit configuration is required in several cases: to service requests that
arrive via a BOOTP relay agent, when the server is multi-homed ie. has multiple
network interfaces, and when any of the subnets share the same physical wire
(see \fIsupernet\fR property below).
.PP
Explicit configuration values are specified in subnet entries stored
under netinfo.  The entries appear as subdirectories of
\fI/config/dhcp/subnets\fR.  The server searches the netinfo
domain hierarchy looking for this directory hierarchy, and stops
when it finds the first occurrence.
.PP
A subnet entry contains the following properties:
.TP
.B name
The name of the subnet, by convention this is the network address
eg. 17.202.40/22 for a subnet with 22 bits of network address.  The
name is not significant to the server.
.TP
.B net_address
IP address for this subnet.
.TP
.B net_mask
IP subnet mask.
.TP
.B client_types
Must be set to "bootp" for BOOTP clients.
.TP
.B net_range
The range of client IP addresses for which this entry applies.
Specified using two IP addresses, the start and end of the range.
.TP
.B dhcp_router
IP address(es) of IP router(s). (optional)
.TP
.B dhcp_domain_name_server
The list of IP addresses for DNS servers. (optional)
.TP
.B dhcp_domain_name
Default domain name. (optional)
.TP
.B supernet
Subnets that share the same physical wire have the same \fIsupernet\fB value.
The value is a string value. (optional)
.PP
Subnet entries may not overlap, or specify values that are inconsistent.
Errors in configuration are logged to \fI/var/log/system.log\fR.  There
may be multiple subnet entries for a given subnet, allowing different
configuration values to be specified for a given range of IP addresses
within the subnet.
.PP
A BOOTP client must set the magic number field (first 4 bytes of the
vendor extensions field) to 99.130.83.99 (dotted decimal) to have
the server fill in the vendor extensions.
